      Tourist Incognito 
    </h3>
    <p>This app was inspired by a discussion based around travel and traveling alone. Amidst this conversation, I realized that safety was a concern for most of the people I interviewed. Understanding why & what people did to provide themselves with a sense of security, became the driving force behind this design. </p>
